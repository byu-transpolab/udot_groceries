# Introduction

The Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) recently adopted a new mission to
"Enhance the Quality of Life through Transportation," alongside a four-part
framework: Better Mobility, Good Health, Connected Communities, and Strong
Economies [@udot2023a]. A critical role of the transportation system in
accomplishing all elements of UDOT's mission is ensuring that all Utah
households have adequate access to quality nutrition and other community
resources. Access to quality nutrition is shown to have a correlation with
mental and physical well being [@francis2012], and there are many communities
that do not have good accessibility to quality nutrition, with the main options
being either more expensive for quality goods, or no quality goods available.

"Accessibility" is an abstract concept without a specific quantitative
definition [@handy1997]. However, using accessibility as a policy measure
requires comparative quantification, and transportation and public health
researchers have constructed several quantitative measures. Some commonly used
measures include:

-   Nearest destination: How close is the nearest grocery store?
-   Opportunities within a travel time: How many grocery stores can be reached
    within 30 minutes?

These types of measures require the researcher to make a series of assumptions
and assertions: why is 30 minutes chosen instead of 40? Is that time by transit
or highway or walking? Should these definitions change for individuals in
different socioeconomic groups? And do people always go to the closest grocery
store to begin with? How much further are people willing to travel to go to a
store that is cheaper or that has a wider variety of goods? A measure that
combines all of these different considerations is desirable.

## Objectives

The objective of this project is to develop an understanding of what variables
and attributes are desirable in grocery stores for populations in different 
areas of Utah, in order to help identify where to make
improvements to increase equitable access to nutrition in Utah. The proposed 
logit model methodology is developed from a connection between three extensive
data sources:

  - A detailed survey of the nutrition market in three Utah communities
  - Location-based services data derived from mobile phone records revealing
    which grocery stores are frequented by residents of different neighborhoods
  - Multi-modal network data providing detailed mobility data by car,
    walking, and public transit.

These data will be combined in order to develop accurate logit models that
demonstrate the variables that are significant to grocery store choice in Utah.
These models could then be used to find accessibility to stores and impact
transportation policy to improve quality of life for all communities in Utah.

## Outline

This document is organized in a typical manner. @sec-literature presents a review
of transportation organizations' efforts to improve general health outcomes in their
communities, followed by a specific review of research exploring the
relationship between nutrition access and health. The methodology for data
collection and modeling is described in @sec-methods and a description of the 
nutrition environment and choice models estimates follows in @sec-results.
@sec-scenarios presents a series of scenarios to which we apply the models estimated
in @sec-results, illustrating the interrelated elements of nutrition quality
and transportation infrastructure in developing more complete access to nutrition.
The document concludes in @sec-conclude with a list of limitations and a pair of 
recommendations to UDOT.
