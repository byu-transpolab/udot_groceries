# Methods

This section describes how we construct a model of access to grocery stores in 
communities in Utah. We first describe the theoretical model, and then describe
data collection efforts to estimate this model and apply it.

## Model

Given the limitations 


\begin{equation} 
  U_{ij} = \beta_{s}f(k_{ij}) + \beta_{j}(x_j)
\end{equation}

In this equation $k_{ij}$ represents the distance from *i* to *j* and $x_{i}$ represents the location attributes of *j*. The variable values are developed using different methods for the impedance travel times and the location attributes. The way that these variables are calculated as well as how the $\beta_{1}$ and $\beta_{2}$ parameters are calculated are described in detail below. 


## Data Collection

To estimate the access

### Attribute Data




### Travel Time Data

### Flow Data
