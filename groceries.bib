  abstract = {Driving speed is an important factor in road safety. Speed not only affects the severity of a crash, but is also related to the risk of being involved in a crash. This paper discusses the most important empirical studies into speed and crash rate with an emphasis on the more recent studies. The majority of these studies looked at absolute speed, either at individual vehicle level or at road section level. Respectively, they found evidence for an exponential function and a power function between speed and crash rate. Both types of studies found evidence that crash rate increases faster with an increase in speed on minor roads than on major roads. At a more detailed level, lane width, junction density, and traffic flow were found to interact with the speed--crash rate relation. Other studies looked at speed dispersion and found evidence that this is also an important factor in determining crash rate. Larger differences in speed between vehicles are related to a higher crash rate. Without exception, a vehicle that moved (much) faster than other traffic around it, had a higher crash rate. With regard to the rate of a (much) slower moving vehicle, the evidence is inconclusive.},

  abstract = {Objectives. We examined whether supermarket choice, conceptualized as a proxy for underlying personal factors, would better predict access to supermarkets and fruit and vegetable consumption than mere physical proximity. Methods. The Seattle Obesity Study geocoded respondents' home addresses and locations of their primary supermarkets. Primary supermarkets were stratified into low, medium, and high cost according to the market basket cost of 100 foods. Data on fruit and vegetable consumption were obtained during telephone surveys. Linear regressions examined associations between physical proximity to primary supermarkets, supermarket choice, and fruit and vegetable consumption. Descriptive analyses examined whether supermarket choice outweighed physical proximity among lower-income and vulnerable groups. Results. Only one third of the respondents shopped at their nearest supermarket for their primary food supply. Those who shopped at low-cost supermarkets were more likely to travel beyond their nearest supermarket. Fruit and vegetable consumption was not associated with physical distance but, with supermarket choice, after adjusting for covariates. Conclusions. Mere physical distance may not be the most salient variable to reflect access to supermarkets, particularly among those who shop by car. Studies on food environments need to focus beyond neighborhood geographic boundaries to capture actual food shopping behaviors.},

  abstract = {Background Access to fresh produce and other healthy foods differs between poor ethnic and wealthier non-ethnic neighborhoods. Given the need to improve access, emergency food organizations, such as food pantries, can provide assistance. Food pantry clients, many living in poor ethnic neighborhoods, are at highest risk for inadequate intake of fruits and vegetables as emergency food assistance often does not include a supply of fresh produce. This study examines the extent to which food pantry clients live within reasonable walking distance of stores carrying fresh produce, and it proposes a strategy to increase accessibility of produce to those clients. Methods Addresses for 3985 food pantry clients residing in Pomona, California, in 2003 and 84 food stores categorized as selling a ``variety of produce'' or ``limited produce'' were geocoded using geographic information systems technology in 2004. A 0.8-km network buffer was used to measure access to stores. Cluster areas with high densities of food pantry clients, or hot spots, were determined. Results Forty-one percent of Pomona food pantry clients were within walking distance of a store with fresh produce. Eighty-three percent were within walking distance of stores with limited produce, and 13\% were not within walking distance of either store type. Seventeen cluster areas of food pantry clients accounted for 48\% of clients with no access to a produce store. Conclusions Using individual-level data allowed for the identification of significant numbers of food pantry clients with limited access to stores carrying a variety of fresh produce. Identification of the location of high concentrations of food pantry clients provides a potential solution to increase fresh fruit and vegetable access via mobile produce trucks.},

  abstract = {Access to a variety of affordable and healthy food has been a critical component in sustainable food-system planning. Research on food accessibility and food deserts (low-income areas with no or limited access to healthy food) can have important policy implications for alleviating health disparities. In the existing food access literature, supermarkets or large chain grocery stores have typically been used as the basis for measuring food access. Independent/non-chain grocers are often left out. We propose a multidimensional accessibility based assessment method to examine whether and how independent grocers help shape the food landscape and their locational strategy. A food desert elimination optimization model is formulated to evaluate the effectiveness of relying on small, full-service grocers for servicing food desert neighborhoods. The empirical study conducted in Tucson, Arizona indicates that, while full-service independent grocers fill some gaps left by chain markets, such stores are more helpful for improving food access diversity; this is reflected by the co-locating patterns of chain and non-chain stores. A few independent stores do, however, primarily serve food deserts in racially/ethnically diverse neighborhoods where higher proportions of residents rely on public assistance program and have limited mobility. Our case study suggests that small, independent grocers may have significant potential to aid in servicing areas with no or limited access to healthy food, particularly if policy incentives are provided.},

However, the extent to which food deserts exist is debated. We review the evidence for the existence of food deserts in socioeconomically disadvantaged areas. Methods We conducted a systematic review of primary, quantitative, observational studies, published in English or French, that used geographic or market-basket approaches in high-income countries. The literature search included electronic and hand searches and peer-reviewed and grey literature from 1966 through 2007. We also contacted key researchers to identify other studies. We analyzed the findings and quality of the studies qualitatively. Results Forty-nine studies in 5 countries met inclusion criteria; the amount and consistency of the evidence varied by country. These studies were a mix of geographic and market-basket approaches, but the methodologic quality of studies and completeness of reported findings were mixed. We found clear evidence for disparities in food access in the United States by income and race. Findings from other high-income countries were sparse and equivocal. Conclusion This review suggests that food deserts exist in the United States, where area-level deprivation compounds individual disadvantage. Evidence for the existence of food deserts in other high-income nations is weak.},

  abstract = {Much of the literature on social exclusion ignores its `spatial' or `mobility' related aspects. This paper seeks to rectify this by examining the mobile processes and infrastructures of travel and transport that engender and reinforce social exclusion in contemporary societies. To the extent to which this issue is addressed, it is mainly organized around the notion of `access' to activities, values and goods. This paper examines this discourse in some detail. It is argued that there are many dimensions of such access, that improving access is a complex matter because of the range of human activities that might need to be `accessed', that in order to know what is to be accessed the changing nature of travel and communications requires examination, and that some dimensions of access are only revealed through changes in the infrastructure that `uncover' previously hidden social exclusions. Claims about access and socio-spatial exclusion routinely make assumptions about what it is to participate effectively in society. We turn this question around, also asking how mobilities of different forms constitute societal values and sets of relations, participation in which may become important for social inclusion. This paper draws upon an extensive range of library, desk and field research to deal with crucial issues relating to the nature of a fair, just and mobile society.},

  abstract = {Distributive environmental justice research on children's exposure to vehicular pollution is underdeveloped and few empirical studies have been conducted in the US. This study seeks to address this gap by examining if socially disadvantaged children are disproportionately located in public school districts burdened by higher vehicular pollution in Texas---the second largest US state based on population size. Vehicular pollution exposure is measured using two variables: (1) an index developed by the US Environmental Protection Agency that combines traffic proximity and volume; and (2) outdoor concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), a widely used proxy for traffic-related air pollution. These variables are linked to school district level data on socio-demographic characteristics of children obtained from the latest American Community Survey. Statistical analysis is based on multivariable generalized estimating equations that account for spatial clustering of school districts. Results reveal significantly greater traffic proximity and NO2 exposure in Texas school districts with higher percentages of children, after controlling for clustering, population density, and other socio-demographic factors. Districts exposed to higher levels of traffic proximity and NO2 exposure also contain significantly greater proportions of racial/ethnic minority, foreign-born, disabled, and socioeconomically vulnerable children. These findings highlight the urgent need to develop mitigation strategies for reducing vehicular pollution exposure, especially in districts with higher proportions of socially disadvantaged students that could be additionally burdened with limited resources. School districts represent a policy relevant analytic unit since school district boards can act as advocates for the environmental health of children and implement mitigation strategies for reducing pollution exposure.},

We also described participant-reported motivations for modal choice for each journey purpose. The study used multilevel models to investigate cross-sectional associations of individual (i.e. age, gender, educational level) and contextual (defined by a combination of residential neighbourhood characteristics in typologies) characteristics with the choice of active and public transport as outcome. Based on an online survey of 6037 residents of Ghent and suburbs (Belgium), Paris and inner suburbs (France), Budapest and suburbs (Hungary), the Randstad (including the cities of Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht in the Netherlands) and Greater London (United Kingdom), we observed associations with both individual and contextual characteristics. Results of the multilevel modelling show that the probability of using active or public transport as main mode varies depending on both individual and contextual characteristics. At individual level, relations with gender, age, education, weight status and having at least one child varied according to main transport mode and/or purpose. For example, overweight participants reported lower level of cycling for commuting and non-commuting travels than normal-weight participants. In the context of non-commuting travels, participants with one or more child reported less public transport use and more walking (vs participants without children). Among contextual-level variables, urban characteristics of the residential neighbourhood defined by four clusters (according to food environment, recreational facilities and active mobility opportunities) were associated with public transport and walking but not with cycling. For active transport the most important reasons were ``I like to travel (on foot or by bike)'' and ``I want to be physically active'' for both travel purposes. ``Public transport facilities nearby'' was indicated as the most important reason for public transport (for both trip purposes) -- the second was ``Journey time''. Our findings highlight the importance of exploring a combination of multiple correlates at individual and contextual level according to journey purposes and suggest that the role of health-related individual characteristics such as weight status need further exploration.},

  abstract = {Decades of air pollution regulation have yielded enormous benefits in the United States, but vehicle emissions remain a climate and public health issue. Studies have quantified the vehicle-related fine particulate matter (PM2.5)-attributable mortality but lack the combination of proper counterfactual scenarios, latest epidemiological evidence, and detailed spatial resolution; all needed to assess the benefits of recent emission reductions. We use this combination to assess PM2.5-attributable health benefits and also assess the climate benefits of on-road emission reductions between 2008 and 2017. We estimate total benefits of \$270 (190 to 480) billion in 2017. Vehicle-related PM2.5-attributable deaths decreased from 27,700 in 2008 to 19,800 in 2017; however, had per-mile emission factors remained at 2008 levels, 48,200 deaths would have occurred in 2017. The 74\% increase from 27,700 to 48,200 PM2.5-attributable deaths with the same emission factors is due to lower baseline PM2.5 concentrations (+26\%), more vehicle miles and fleet composition changes (+22\%), higher baseline mortality (+13\%), and interactions among these (+12\%). Climate benefits were small (3 to 19\% of the total). The percent reductions in emissions and PM2.5-attributable deaths were similar despite an opportunity to achieve disproportionately large health benefits by reducing high-impact emissions of passenger light-duty vehicles in urban areas. Increasingly large vehicles and an aging population, increasing mortality, suggest large health benefits in urban areas require more stringent policies. Local policies can be effective because high-impact primary PM2.5 and NH3 emissions disperse little outside metropolitan areas. Complementary national-level policies for NOx are merited because of its substantial impacts---with little spatial variability---and dispersion across states and metropolitan areas.},

The motivations and rationale behind travel and provisioning choices of the working poor and the resources available to them are examined by means of a series of semistructured interviews conducted with members of twenty-six low-income house-holds residing in the Austin, Texas, area. The ways that these households cope with their mobility and economic disadvantage are complex, logical, and varied; depend on their resources and circumstances; and must be flexible to deal with day-to-day occurrences. Evidence from this study shows that the flexibility afforded by the automobile widens the spatial and temporal aspects of mobility, allowing for a more extensive search for goods and services. The automobile is an important mode for nonwork travel, even among those households that do not own one. However, the transit and walking remain critical in providing the mobility needed to access food-shopping destinations for these families.},

Methods An online questionnaire linked to a seven-day travel diary provided demographic, health and detailed trip taking behaviour, across three waves between September 2013 and November 2015 in Sydney, Australia. 532 participants provided 23,776 trips for analysis. Mixed effects logistic regression, clustered by participant ID as a random effect and adjusted for wave as a fixed effect, was used to examine health characteristics of multimodal travellers, and to test associations between taking different modal combinations and an individual's reporting of sufficient physical activity (PA) and quality of life (QoL). Results Most of the 5,494 trips identified as multimodal involved public transport (PT) with active travel (AT) for access or egress. Individuals taking unimodal AT trips reported better QoL (AOR 1.25, p~{$<~$}0.001) and increased likelihood to report sufficient PA for health (AOR 1.17, p~=~0.046), while individuals taking multimodal PT~+~AT trips reported better QoL (AOR 1.26, p~=~0.005), compared with those taking unimodal private motor trips. Conclusion While modal interchange is often cited as having a negative impact on traveller satisfaction, our findings suggest there are no discernible impacts on QoL. On the contrary, multimodal trips may be associated with positive QoL outcomes in the case of public transport and active travel combinations. This finding supports the potential of integrated public transport and active travel modes as a sustainable alternative to the car, contributing to overall health and wellbeing.},

  abstract = {There is a need for indicators of transportation--land use system quality that are understandable to a wide range of stakeholders and that can provide immediate feedback on the quality of interactively designed scenarios. Location-based accessibility indicators are promising candidates, but indicator values can vary strongly depending on time of day and transfer wait times. Capturing this variation increases complexity, slowing calculations. This paper presents new methods for rapid yet rigorous computation of accessibility metrics, allowing immediate feedback during early-stage transit planning while being rigorous enough for final analyses. The approach is statistical, characterizing the uncertainty and variability in accessibility metrics related to differences in departure time and headway-based scenario specification. The analysis was carried out on a detailed multimodal network model including both public transportation and streets. Land use data were represented at high resolution. These methods were implemented as open-source software running on a commodity cloud infrastructure. Networks were constructed from standard open data sources, and scenarios were built in a map-based web interface. A case study is presented, describing how these methods were applied in a long-term transportation planning process for an urbanized, polycentric Randstad region in the Netherlands.},

Transit travel times contain variation depending on when one departs relative to when a transit vehicle arrives, and how well transfers are coordinated given a particular timetable. In addition, there is necessarily uncertainty in the value of the accessibility metric during sketch planning processes, due to scenarios which are underspecified because detailed schedule information is not yet available. This article presents a method to extend the concept of "reliable" accessibility to transit to address the first issue, and create confidence intervals and hypothesis tests to address the second.},

It is difficult to include fares in shortest-path algorithms because fares are often path-dependent. When fare policies allow discounted transfers, for example, the fare for a given journey segment depends on characteristics of previous journey segments. Existing methods to characterize tradeoffs between travel time and monetary cost objectives do not scale well to complex networks, or they rely on approximations. Additionally, they often require assumed values of time, which may be problematic for evaluating the equity of service provision. We propose a new method that allows us to find Pareto sets of paths, jointly minimizing fare and travel time. Using a case study in greater Boston, Massachusetts, USA, we test the algorithm's performance as part of an interactive web application for computing accessibility metrics. Potential extensions for journey planning and route choice models are also discussed.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates the effect of food environments, characterized as food swamps, on adult obesity rates. Food swamps have been described as areas with a high-density of establishments selling high-calorie fast food and junk food, relative to healthier food options. This study examines multiple ways of categorizing food environments as food swamps and food deserts, including alternate versions of the Retail Food Environment Index. We merged food outlet, sociodemographic and obesity data from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Food Environment Atlas, the American Community Survey, and a commercial street reference dataset. We employed an instrumental variables (IV) strategy to correct for the endogeneity of food environments (i.e., that individuals self-select into neighborhoods and may consider food availability in their decision). Our results suggest that the presence of a food swamp is a stronger predictor of obesity rates than the absence of full-service grocery stores. We found, even after controlling for food desert effects, food swamps have a positive, statistically significant effect on adult obesity rates. All three food swamp measures indicated the same positive association, but reflected different magnitudes of the food swamp effect on rates of adult obesity (p values ranged from 0.00 to 0.16). Our adjustment for reverse causality, using an IV approach, revealed a stronger effect of food swamps than would have been obtained by na{\"i}ve ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates. The food swamp effect was stronger in counties with greater income inequality (p {$<$} 0.05) and where residents are less mobile (p {$<$} 0.01). Based on these findings, local government policies such as zoning laws simultaneously restricting access to unhealthy food outlets and incentivizing healthy food retailers to locate in underserved neighborhoods warrant consideration as strategies to increase health equity.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the results of a research project aiming to develop a robust empirical model to measure links between transport disadvantage (TD), social exclusion (SE) and well-being (WB). Its principal aim is to improve on current research methods in this field. Existing approaches derive associations between TD and its impacts through simple comparative methods, through qualitative methods and using limited and prescriptive definitions of SE. The new method draws from an interview questionnaire measuring TD through self-reported difficulties with transport. A principal components analysis of responses identifies four statistically significant sub-scales (transit disadvantage, transport disadvantage, vulnerable/impaired and rely on others). SE is represented in five dimensions including income, unemployment, political engagement, participation in activities and social support networks. Well-being adopts standard psychological measures---`Satisfaction With Life Scale' (SWLS), `Positive Affect' (PA) and `Negative Affect' (NA). Structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to model links between TD, SE and WB. A hypothesised model proposed negative associations between SE and WB and between TD and WB and a positive association between TD and SE. Modelling results showed that scales used to measure TD, SE and WB were all statistically related to their underlying concepts. Modelling of the hypothesised links between constructs was generally favourable with a good statistical fit. However the relationship between TD and WB was not significant. An exploratory analysis supported the hypothesis that this was caused by high reported travel difficulties for both highly mobile and less mobile people. A revised theoretical model explored the theory that feelings of isolation due to time poverty might be mediating the TD-WB link. SEM analysis of the revised model confirmed a good model fit with statistically significant measures between TD, time poverty and WB. Time poverty was not found to be associated with social exclusion. The final model suggested that TD is positively associated with SE with a measured strength of .27. SE is strongly negatively associated with WB (-.87). TD is positively associated with time poverty (.19) while time poverty is negatively associated with well-being (-.14). Areas for future research are identified.},

The current situation of sustainable mobility and its analysis is a first step in understanding the factors that would encourage residents to discover and choose alternative modes of travel. The present study examined the factors that encourage the choice of active modes of travel among urban adult population. Walking and cycling were analyzed as the most sustainable forms of urban mobility from the perspective of car and public transport (PT) users. Total of 902 subjects aged 18 years or older were analyzed in the study to assess commuting habits in Kaunas city, Lithuania. The majority (61.1\%) of the respondents used a passenger vehicle, 28.2\% used PT, and only 13.5\% used active modes of travel. The results showed that safer pedestrian crossings, and comfortable paths were the most significant factors that encourage walking. A wider cycling network, and bicycle safety were the most important incentives for the promotion of cycling. Our findings show that the main factors encouraging walking and cycling among car and PT users are similar, however, the individual characteristics that determine the choice of these factors vary significantly.},

There were very clear differences in mobility and car reliance between geographic locations. Car reliance peaked in fringe Melbourne with regional areas showing slightly less car reliance. Mobility and kilometres travelled also increased with distance from central Melbourne, which in turn resulted in greater sensitivity to fuel price increases. Again these factors were greatest in fringe Melbourne. Links between transport disadvantage and social exclusion were small and inconsistent in this paper although they have been demonstrated in other research. Links between transport disadvantage and well-being were strongest in the regional sample. The implications of these findings and their connection to the transport literature are discussed.},

  abstract = {This paper studies the properties and performance of a new measure of accessibility, called the activity-based accessibility (ABA) measure, and compares it to traditional measures of accessibility, including isochrone, gravity and utility-based measures. The novel aspect of the ABA is that it measures accessibility to all activities in which an individual engages, incorporating constraints such as scheduling, and travel characteristics such as trip chaining. The ABA is generated from the day activity schedule (DAS) model system, an integrated system based on the concept of an activity pattern, which identifies the sequence and tour structure among all the activities and trips taken by an individual during a day. A byproduct is an individual's expected maximum utility over the choices of all available activity patterns, and from this the ABA is derived. The ABA is related to the logsum accessibility measures frequently derived from destination and mode discrete choice models. The key difference is that it is generated not by examining a particular trip, but by examining all trips and activities throughout the day. A case study using data from Portland, Oregon, demonstrates the rich picture of accessibility made available by use of the ABA, and highlights differences between the ABA and more traditional measures of accessibility. The ABA is successful in (a) capturing taste heterogeneity across individuals (not possible with aggregate accessibility measures), (b) combining different types of trips into a unified measure of accessibility (not possible with trip-based measures), (c) reflecting the impact of scheduling and trip chaining on accessibility (not possible with trip-based measures), and (d) quantifying differing accessibility impacts on important segments of the population such as unemployed and zero auto households (not possible with aggregate measures, and limited with trip-based measures).}

Transport mode has been shown to be associated to body mass index (BMI), yet there is limited longitudinal evidence demonstrating causality. We aimed to associate transport mode and BMI cross-sectionally, but also prospectively in the first ever European-wide longitudinal study on transport and health. Methods Data were from the PASTA project that recruited adults in seven European cities (Antwerp, Barcelona, London, Oerebro, Rome, Vienna, Zurich) to complete a series of questionnaires on travel behavior, physical activity levels, and BMI. To assess the association between transport mode and BMI as well as change in BMI we performed crude and adjusted linear mixed-effects modeling for cross-sectional (n\,=\,7380) and longitudinal (n\,=\,2316) data, respectively. Results Cross-sectionally, BMI was 0.027\,kg/m2 (95\%CI 0.015 to 0.040) higher per additional day of car use per month. Inversely, BMI was -0.010\,kg/m2 (95\%CI -0.020 to -0.0002) lower per additional day of cycling per month. Changes in BMI were smaller in the longitudinal within-person assessment, however still statistically significant. BMI decreased in occasional (less than once per week) and non-cyclists who increased cycling (-0.303\,kg/m2, 95\%CI -0.530 to -0.077), while frequent (at least once per week) cyclists who stopped cycling increased their BMI (0.417\,kg/m2, 95\%CI 0.033 to 0.802). Conclusions Our analyses showed that people lower their BMI when starting or increasing cycling, demonstrating the health benefits of active mobility.},

The destinations are jobs, parks, groceries, hospitals, schools, and libraries. We show that there are clear inequalities across cohorts in the distribution of benefits that the transit system provides as measured by the number of reachable valued destinations. The results indicate that areas of low accessibility have a higher percentage of African-Americans, Hispanics, Asians, low-income workers, low-educated citizens, and the elderly. The most affected cohort are low-income workers, for whom access to jobs, parks, groceries, hospitals, and libraries decline as their number grows. The findings also highlight that inequities are most severe, in order, to jobs, hospitals, and grocery stores when examining the different cohorts. While transit agencies must deploy service with the existing demand in mind, the observed inequities behoove decision makers to make accessibility and equity considerations explicit in transit service decisions.},

Our modeled policy scenarios account for a suite of emission control requirements affecting many of these sectors. Between these two years, the number of PM2.5 and ozone-related deaths attributable to power plants and mobile sources falls from about 68\,000 (90\% confidence interval from 48\,000 to 87\,000) to about 36\,000 (90\% confidence intervals from 26\,000 to 47\,000). Area source mortality risk grows slightly between 2005 and 2016, due largely to population growth. Uncertainties relating to the timing and magnitude of the emission reductions may affect the size of these estimates.

FHWA's Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways includes a walking speed of 4.0 ft/s (1.2 m/s) for calculating pedestrian clearance intervals for traffic signals. It also includes a comment that where pedestrians who walk slower than normal, or pedestrians who use wheelchairs, routinely use the crosswalk, a walking speed of less than 4.0 ft/s should be considered in determining the pedestrian clearance times. A 2005 TCRP-NCHRP study found a 15th percentile walking speed for young pedestrians of 3.77 ft/s (1.15 m/s) and a 15th percentile walking speed for older pedestrians of 3.03 ft/s (0.92 m/s). The study also determined that there is a statistical difference in walking speeds between older (older than 60 years) and younger (60 years and younger) pedestrians. Using population projections and the 15th percentile walking speeds for each population group more than 15 years old, the proportionally weighted 15th percentile walking speed for 2045 is 3.56 ft/s (1.09 m/s). Comparing the findings from the TCRP-NCHRP study with previous work results in the following recommendations: 3.5-ft/s (1.07-m/s) walking speed for timing of a traffic signal; if older pedestrians are a concern, then a 3.0-ft/s (0.9-m/s) walking speed should be used.},

  abstract = {Mental health is a public health priority globally. Public Open Space (POS) may enhance mental health by facilitating contact with nature and the development of supportive relationships. Despite growing interest in the influence of the built environment on mental health, associations between POS attributes and mental health remain relatively unexplored. In particular, few studies have examined the relative effects of the quantity and quality of POS within a neighbourhood on mental health. Guided by a social--ecological framework, this study investigated the relationship between POS attributes (i.e., quantity and quality) and better mental health (i.e., low risk of psychological distress) in residents of new housing developments in the Perth metropolitan area, Western Australia. The extent to which relationships between POS attributes and mental health were confounded by psychosocial factors (e.g., social support, sense of community) and frequent use of POS was also explored. Data were obtained from a cross-sectional survey (n~=~911), a POS audit, and Geographical Information Systems, and was analysed using logistic regression. Approximately 80\% of survey participants were at low risk of psychological distress. Residents of neighbourhoods with high quality POS had higher odds of low psychosocial distress than residents of neighbourhoods with low quality POS. This appeared to be irrespective of whether or not they used POS. However, the quantity of neighbourhood POS was not associated with low psychological distress. From a mental health perspective, POS quality within a neighbourhood appears to be more important than POS quantity. This finding has policy implications and warrants further investigation.},

  abstract = {Background Lack of access to healthy foods may explain why residents of low-income neighborhoods and African Americans in the U.S. have high rates of obesity. The findings on where people shop and how that may influence health are mixed. However, multiple policy initiatives are underway to increase access in communities that currently lack healthy options. Few studies have simultaneously measured obesity, distance, and prices of the store used for primary food shopping. Purpose To examine the relationship among distance to store, food prices, and obesity. Methods The Pittsburgh Hill/Homewood Research on Eating, Shopping, and Health study conducted baseline interviews with 1,372 households between May and December 2011 in two low-income, majority African American neighborhoods without a supermarket. Audits of 16 stores where participants reported doing their major food shopping were conducted. Data were analyzed between February 2012 and February 2013. Results Distance to store and prices were positively associated with obesity (p{$<$}0.05). When distance to store and food prices were jointly modeled, only prices remained significant (p{$<$}0.01), with higher prices predicting a lower likelihood of obesity. Although low- and high-price stores did not differ in availability, they significantly differed in their display and marketing of junk foods relative to healthy foods. Conclusions Placing supermarkets in food deserts to improve access may not be as important as simultaneously offering better prices for healthy foods relative to junk foods, actively marketing healthy foods, and enabling consumers to resist the influence of junk food marketing.},

This article reports on the development and evaluation of measures of nutrition environments in retail food stores. Methods The Nutrition Environment Measures Study developed observational measures of the nutrition environment within retail food stores (NEMS-S) to assess availability of healthy options, price, and quality. After pretesting, measures were completed by independent raters to evaluate inter-rater reliability and across two occasions to assess test--retest reliability in grocery and convenience stores in four neighborhoods differing on income and community design in the Atlanta metropolitan area. Data were collected and analyzed in 2004 and 2005. Results Ten food categories (e.g., fruits) or indicator food items (e.g., ground beef) were evaluated in 85 stores. Inter-rater reliability and test--retest reliability of availability were high: inter-rater reliability kappas were 0.84 to 1.00, and test--retest reliabilities were .73 to 1.00. Inter-rater reliability for quality across fresh produce was moderate (kappas, 0.44 to 1.00). Healthier options were higher priced for hot dogs, lean ground beef, and baked chips. More healthful options were available in grocery than convenience stores and in stores in higher income neighborhoods. Conclusions The NEMS-S tool was found to have a high degree of inter-rater and test--retest reliability, and to reveal significant differences across store types and neighborhoods of high and low socioeconomic status. These observational measures of nutrition environments can be applied in multilevel studies of community nutrition, and can inform new approaches to conducting and evaluating nutrition interventions.},

We continue to debate this assertion because empirical studies over decades have conflicting results. This research examines whether the poor face spatial mismatch and how suburbanization has changed their job accessibility, in the Los Angeles region between 1990 and 2007--2011. I define spatial mismatch as occurring when the poor in the inner city have lower job accessibility than their suburban counterparts. I estimate job accessibility based on the spatial distribution of jobs and job seekers traveling via private automobiles. My results present a complicated picture: Inner-city poor job seekers have higher job accessibility than their suburban counterparts because many jobs remain in the inner city; thus, the inner-city poor do not face spatial mismatch. Moreover, suburbanization has evened out the differences in the job accessibility of the poor and non-poor. However, the advantage of living in the inner city for job access declines with rapid employment suburbanization.Takeaway for practice: My research suggests that, since the poor do not face spatial mismatch, spatial policies commonly advocated to address their employment challenges---moving people to the suburbs, bringing jobs to the inner city, or providing mobility options---will not be effective. Giving people cars can help overcome both spatial and nonspatial barriers, but is not politically feasible. Planners should develop synergetic policies to complement spatial approaches including reducing labor and housing market discrimination, providing education and training, developing better job search skills, and creating supportive social connections.},

Bootstrapped generalized additive logit regressions (GAM) were built to predict traffic conflict likelihood. Results show that while cycling on an off-street bike path effectively reduces the likelihood of conflict with a vehicle, it increases the probability of conflict with a pedestrian.

This study aimed to develop and demonstrate an empirically-derived and spatially-represented index of park access (ParkIndex) that would allow researchers, planners, and citizens to evaluate the potential for park use for a given area. Methods Data used for developing ParkIndex were collected in 2010 in Kansas City, Missouri (KCMO). Adult study participants (n=891) reported whether they used a park within the past month, and all parks in KCMO were mapped and audited using ArcGIS 9.3 and the Community Park Audit Tool. Four park summary variables --- distance to nearest park, and the number of parks, amount of park space, and average park quality index within 1mile were analyzed in relation to park use using logistic regression. Coefficients for significant park summary variables were used to create a raster surface (ParkIndex) representing the probability of park use for all 100m{\texttimes}100m cells in KCMO. Results Two park summary variables were positively associated with park use --- the number of parks and the average park quality index within 1 mile. The ParkIndex probability of park use across all cells in KCMO ranged from 17 to 77 out of 100. Conclusion ParkIndex represents a standardized metric of park access that combines elements of both park availability and quality, which was developed empirically and can be represented spatially.

Despite methodological improvements in assessing food environments, their associations with food behaviors have remained inconsistent. We argue that one possible reason for these inconsistencies is the lack of information about how an individual's time use dynamics play out in space. To this point, few studies on the combined effects of food geography and time use on food behaviors exist, and methods to achieve such analyses have been underdeveloped. In this study, we propose a novel application of multi-channel sequence analysis (MCSA) to identify joint patterns of time use and food-related geographic contexts. We explore how those spatiotemporal patterns are associated with individuals' food shopping and food-related household chores. This analytical workflow is demonstrated using time use diaries and GPS trajectories collected in Toronto in 2019. This test case identifies spatiotemporal patterns with distinctive characteristics of disaggregated time use and spatial exposure to food retail and finds associations between these distinct space-time patterns and participation in food-related activities. This application of MCSA affords a promising novel approach for food environment researchers to perform nuanced assessments of the sequenced spatiotemporal contexts in which food-related behaviors occur.},

Existing approaches often simplify their measure of proximity by using large areal units and by imposing arbitrary distance thresholds. By doing so, these approaches risk overlooking vulnerable, access-poor populations -- the very populations that such studies are often trying to identify. These limitations are primarily motivated by computational constraints. However, recent advances in computational power, open data, and open-source analytics permit high-resolution proximity analyses on large scales. Given the impetus for equitable accessibility in our communities, this is of fundamental importance for researchers and practitioners. In this paper, we present an approach that leverages these open source advances to (a) measure proximity using network distance at the building level, (b) estimate population at that level, and (c) present the resulting distributions so vulnerable populations can be identified. Using three cities and modes of transport, we demonstrate how the approach enhances existing measures and identifies service-poor populations where the previous methods fall short. The proximity results could be used alone, or as inputs to access metrics. Our collating of these components into an open source code provides opportunities for researchers and practitioners to explore fine-resolution, city-wide accessibility across multiple cities and the host of questions that follow.},

  abstract = {Introduction Health problems such as obesity and related illnesses have been attributed to the lack of both spatial and economic access to healthy food. Even though access to healthy food in urban areas has been widely studied, access to healthy food in rural areas has not received much attention to date. Rural residents usually face similar accessibility challenges as urban populations but at a greater magnitude. The lack of access to reliable transportation in rural areas acts as a barrier to accessing healthy food, especially for individuals that might not have access to an automobile. Methodology This paper uses a cost-based accessibility measure and estimates spatial econometric models to identify the differences between healthy food accessibility in rural and urban areas considering multiple transportation modes available in those areas. Furthermore, the paper explores the relationship between healthy food accessibility and the characteristics of the built environment that can be used to advise planning decisions and policy. Four study areas in Indiana were selected to demonstrate the study methodology. Results Both the location of healthy food providers and infrastructure that allows access by different modes are spatially clustered. Urban area residents incur a lower average cost to reach healthy food, especially when driving and walking are considered, compared to rural areas. The spatial models' results suggested that built environment characteristics, especially land-use characteristics, influence the cost to reach healthy food providers in urban areas, regardless of the mode. Conclusions The solution to facilitate access to healthy food providers is not a one-size-fits-all approach. However, transportation innovations such as mobile markets, ridesharing, drone delivery, and autonomous delivery services can serve to bring closer healthy food to the population that cannot access it by their current means. This paper's methodology involves publicly available data that allow for easy replication by any planning agency.},

In this paper, we apply a comprehensive measure of park accessibility drawn from random utility choice theory, which avoids arbitrary assertions of proximity while incorporating potentially numerous amenities and attributes of both the parks and the population. We apply this utility-based accessibility measure to correlate Census tract-level obesity and physical activity rate estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's 500 Cities project with tract-level American Community Survey socioeconomic data in New York City, paired with geographic open space data from New York City. Controlling for the socioeconomic variables and spatially correlated error terms, we show a positive and significant relationship between park access and physical activity rates. The data also suggest a negative relationship between park access and obesity rates, beyond what is expected through physical activity and socioeconomics. In doing so, this research contributes a more comprehensive modeling approach for measuring the impact of park access on health, and may improve our understanding of the role parks and access to them can serve in furthering public health objectives.},

These conversions improved access to public open space, but measuring the variation in that improvement among different populations requires clear definitions of access and methods for measuring it. In this study, we evaluate the change in a utility-based park accessibility measure resulting from street conversions in Alameda County, California. Our utility-based accessibility measure is constructed from a park activity location choice model we estimate using mobile device data -- supplied by StreetLight Data, Inc. -- representing trips to parks in that county. The estimated model reveals heterogeneity in inferred affinity for park attributes among different sociodemographic groups. We find, for example, that neighborhoods with more lower-income residents and those with more residents of color show a greater preference for park proximty while neighborhods with higher incomes and those with more white residents show a greater preference for park size and amenities. We then apply this model to examine the accessibility benefits resulting from COVID-19 street conversions to create a set of small park-like open spaces; we find that this has been a pro-social policy in that Black, Hispanic, and low-income households receive a disproportionate share of the policy benefits, relative to the population distribution.},

  abstract = {Objective To assess the relationship between greenspace exposure and childhood internalizing and externalizing behaviors. Study design We analyzed data from the Cincinnati Childhood Allergy and Air Pollution Study, an ongoing prospective birth cohort. Greenspace exposure was estimated based on children's addresses using normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) images. Neurobehavioral outcomes were assessed using the Behavioral Assessment System for Children, Second Edition. Regression models adjusted for neighborhood deprivation, maternal education, race, and sex assessed the risk for problematic internalizing and externalizing behaviors at residential greenspace buffers of 200, 400, and 800 m. Results There were 562 and 313 children in our age 7- and 12-year analyses, respectively. At age 7 years, a 0.1-unit increase in NDVI was associated with decreased conduct scores ({$\beta$}\,=\,-1.10, 95\% CI [-2.14, -0.06], 200 m). At age 12 years, a 0.1-unit increase in NDVI was associated with a decrease in anxiety scores ({$\beta$}\,=\,-1.83, 95\% CI [-3.44, -0.22], 800 m), decreased depression scores ({$\beta$}\,=\,-1.36, 95\% CI [-2.61, -0.12], 200 m), and decreased somatization scores ({$\beta$}\,=\,-1.83, 95\% CI [-3.22, -0.44], 200 m). Conclusions This study provides evidence that increased exposure to residential greenspace is associated with reduced youth's problematic internal and external behaviors, measured by Behavioral Assessment System for Children, Second Edition, at ages 7 and 12 years. Improved understanding of this mechanism could allow for implementation of neighborhood-level approaches for reducing the risk for childhood behavioral problems.},

  abstract = {Introduction One of the most consequential effects of the COVID-19 lockdowns was a dramatic reduction in travel during peak hours. Transportation modes also shifted---in particular, travel by car became more rare while bicycling saw a resurgence. Given that a typical year sees the most severe bicycle crashes in peak commuter traffic, the shift toward bicycle travel that occurred in 2020 will likely have been accompanied by unique changes in rider behavior (e.g., where and when they choose to ride) as well as the frequency and severity of vehicle-bicycle crashes. Methods The current study compared weekday bicycle traffic and crashes in Arlington, VA from March--December 2020 with the same period from years prior, 2013--2019. Bicycle traffic data were obtained from 16 embedded counters placed throughout the study area, in both off-road trails and on-road bike lanes. Results We found that 2020 midday traffic nearly doubled compared to the year before, increasing from an average of 68 riders per hour to 120 (+76\%). By contrast, morning traffic fell from an average of 87 riders per hour to just 45 (-49\%). Change in evening traffic depended on the location of the counters: more evening bicycles were counted on off-road, multi-use trails (+6\%) but fewer on on-road lanes (-27\%). The changes to 2020 bicycle traffic patterns were also associated with a 28\% reduction in bicycle injury crash rate per counted cyclist. Conclusion The reduced crash risk observed in 2020 was likely due in part to the reduction of morning, on-road bicycle travel, which past research has found to be particularly dangerous for riders. Conversely, the availability of multi-use off-road trails seems to have been a protective factor against bicycle-motor vehicle crash risk in the face of greater bicycle travel volume.},

The World Health Organization attributes 3.8 million additional deaths to indoor air pollution. Air pollution can harm acutely, usually manifested by respiratory or cardiac symptoms, as well as chronically, potentially affecting every organ in the body. It can cause, complicate, or exacerbate many adverse health conditions. Tissue damage may result directly from pollutant toxicity because fine and ultrafine particles can gain access to organs, or indirectly through systemic inflammatory processes. Susceptibility is partly under genetic and epigenetic regulation. Although air pollution affects people of all regions, ages, and social groups, it is likely to cause greater illness in those with heavy exposure and greater susceptibility. Persons are more vulnerable to air pollution if they have other illnesses or less social support. Harmful effects occur on a continuum of dosage and even at levels below air quality standards previously considered to be safe.},

  abstract = {This paper describes the development of an area-based index of locational access to community services, facilities and amenities. The index enables comparisons to be made across urban neighbourhoods and provides a starting-point from which to identify relationships between opportunity structures in the local environment and residents' health and well-being. The index is based on six domains: recreational amenities, public transport and communication, shopping and banking facilities, educational services, health services, and social and cultural services. The inclusion of specific resources was determined by their relevance to the daily lives of parents/caregivers of young children. However, the methodology has applicability to diverse population groups. Construction of the index, using geographical information systems, and its potential use for locality-based policy and planning are discussed.},

  abstract = {The theory of food deserts is that poor people eat poor diets in part because fresh, healthy food is not accessible in areas where they tend to live. We review evidence from a number of disciplines on various elements of this theory and find it wanting. Access to a car is, for most, a more important consideration than access to a full service supermarket. Moreover, a number of cases are reviewed where full service supermarkets were opened in food deserts, usually with little effect on shopping or eating habits.},
