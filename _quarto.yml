  abstract: | 
    Convenient access to high-quality nutrition is a critical element of public
    health as well as an important interface between communities and the transportation
    system. In this research, we seek to construct a detailed picture of the 
    nutrition environment in three communities in Utah, alongside the community
    members' ability to access that environment through multiple transportation
    modes. In doing so we construct a utility-based accessiblity model enabled 
    by modern mobility device data. This model reveals the tradeoffs between the 
    quality and price of goods on one hand and the distance traveled to reach
    them on the other. We then apply this model to a series of potential 
    access-improving policies: building a new store, improving an existing store, and
    improving the non-automobile transport network between residents and existing
    stores. The results show that new or improved store locations bring substantially
    higher benefits than improvements to the transportation system, at likely
    lower costs. The report recommends that UDOT work to increase the availability
    of community-sized grocery stores in low-access areas, and consider 
    activity-based methods of measuring resource access.
