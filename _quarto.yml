  abstract: | 
   One of the more recent topics in transportation policy making and project
   prioritization in DOTâ€™s across the United States is how to improve quality of
   life. This quality of life focus is an intersection of public health and
   transportation and has many different branches including traffic safety,
   pollution,
   active transportation, equity, and accessibility to resources. The topic among
   these that seems to receive the least attention is equitable access to
   resources. However, with the proven impact that equitable access to resources
   has on physical and emotional well-being, as well as economic opportunity it is
   important to ensure that all populations, including minority and low income
   populations have the same accessibility as those in the majority and high income
   populations. Transportation and public health researchers have constructed
   several quantitative measures to define accessibility, but the most frequent
   methods used lack the ability to include quality measures of the resource or a
   variable distance threshold. Therefore, it is important to use a more inclusive
   definition of accessibility that we can develop using a utility-based
   accessibility model. This paper develops a logit model with different variables
   and parameters in order to identify which variables are important and should be
   included in accessibility measures. The variables come from the impedance
   attributes for the different modes of travel and the location attributes that
   were obtained from a nutritional environment 
   survey conducted in three counties in Utah. The parameters were developed using
   LBS data and identifying flows from home block groups to grocery stores, and
   then creating synthetic trips with non-chosen alternatives. After the utility
   model is created, we are able to use those utility values to create different
   logit models, each having a different set of variables included. These logit
   models were analyzed to find the variables that have a significance on the
   model. From the models it was found that cost of goods, as well as availability
   of quality goods have a significant impact on which grocery stores were chosen
   in the model. In addition, other variables such as size of store and mode of
   travel have a significance as well. From the models identified, it was found
   that in order to have an accurate accessibility model it is important to include
   these variables that are found to be significant in grocery store choice. These
   results can help with developing transportation policies and help to improve
   equitable access in cities.
