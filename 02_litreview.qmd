This chapter presents an overview of existing transportation energy policies
related to health broadly, followed by a review of the literature on access to
nutrition specifically.

## Existing Transportation and Health Policies

Transportation policy impacts the way our transportation systems function in
cities, and along with that, impact the way that we live our lives as well. For
example, transportation policy that demands a certain level of safety on
roadways creates a better, safer, travel network for those using the roads.
Also, policy that puts the pedestrian first helps improve the quality and
quantity of sidewalks and bike ways in cities, improving active transportation.
There are many different types of policies that can be established, whether they
be required by federal law, or established through the individual decisions of
local or state governments. Because these policies make such a big impact on the
way we live it is important to discover what types of policies exist currently,
where there are areas that are missing in policy and practice, and discover how
this research can help to bridge the gap between identified need and practical
application.

How UDOT and other departments of transportation (DOTs) approach their
responsibility to improve quality of life beyond providing mobility is a
relatively recent concern. In this section, we discuss how DOTs have begun
incorporating public health concerns into their policy making and project
prioritization processes.

Transportation impacts public health across several different sectors identified
in the literature, which have been grouped together into four general
topics:Traffic Safety, Pollution, Active Transportation, and Access to Community
Resources. These four topics mirror the focus points of the UDOT mission, with
Traffic Safety and Pollution corresponding to Good Health, Active Transportation
corresponding to Better Mobility, and Access to Community Resources
corresponding to Connected Communities and Strong Economies.

### Traffic Safety

Arguably the area where most attention has been given in terms of a public
health perspective informing transportation decision making concerns vehicle and
roadway safety. This attention is deserved, as transportation safety is a major
public health concern. In 2021 there were 329 total fatalities and 1734 serious
injuries resulting from car crashes in Utah, the highest it has been in the past
8 years [@zerofatalities]. Efforts to improve traffic safety in policy take
various forms.

One of the strategies to improve safety focuses on educating the public to
minimize reckless and distracted driving. Research clearly shows the danger of
both reckless and distracted driving and we have seen a recent national focus on
eliminating distracted driving [@aarts2006,
@nationalhighwaytrafficsafetyadministration2022]. In response, Utah has
implemented the Zero Fatalities program, focusing on decreasing the number of
roadway fatalities to zero by educating the public on deadly driving behaviors,
including distracted driving, aggressive driving, drowsy driving, impaired
driving, and not wearing seat belts [@zerofatalities2022]. Zero Fatalities has
different age-specific educational materials for students and teachers. These
age groups include pre-drivers, new licensed teenagers, experienced drivers, and
even driving instructors. But, educating the public does not solve all safety
concerns; if the roadways themselves are not safe for the drivers, there needs
to be a change to those roadways as well.

Efforts to change the roadways have focused on improving facilities design to
enhance safety for cars as well as for bikes and pedestrians [@charreire2021,
@jarry2021, @monfort2021]. In 2012 the Federal Highway Administration
established a federal aid program titled the Safe System Approach that focuses
on different programs including the Strategic Highway Safety Plan (SHSP),
Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP), Railroad-Highway Crossings Program
(RHCP), and High Risk Rural Roads (HRRR) [@finkel2020]. Of these four programs
included in the safe system approach, the HSIP is the only one that has been
mandated and implemented in every state, including Utah. The HSIP gives federal
funding for projects, plans, activities, and reports that improve safety of
highways.

Vision Zero [@visionzeronetwork2022] is a safety program funded by a non-profit
organization that has been implemented in many communities and combines
improving facilities and educating the public. Vision Zero is a tool to help
communities create action plans and strategies. In order to be involved in
Vision Zero the following must be true:

-   the community must have a clear goal and plan with a process in place to
    accomplish the goals (including a target date for when the community will
    reach zero fatalities)
-   the community leader must declare that they are joining the Vision Zero
    community to strive for zero fatalities on the roadway.

This program is a multinational road traffic safety program and something that
has potential to greatly improve traffic safety in communities where it is
implemented. The Vision Zero focus is to eliminate traffic fatalities and severe
injuries with a clear strategy or plan. A map showing the communities involved
is in @fig-visionzero. Vision Zero has not been implemented in any communities
in Utah. Two major differences between Vison Zero and Utah's Zero Fatalities
program are that Zero Fatalities does not yet have a specific target date of
when the state will reach zero fatalities, and Vision Zero typically includes
many stakeholders such as transportation professionals, policy makers, public
health officials, police, and community members.

### Pollution and Environmental Justice

Another place where transportation and public health intersect is pollution and
related environmental justice issues. A large percentage of airborne pollution
comes from vehicle emissions including over 55% of nitrogen oxides (NOx), less
than 10% of volatile organic compounds (VOC), and less than 10% of particulate
matter (PM). Vehicle emissions are of the largest contributors to PM2.5 levels
around the globe. Studies have shown the impact of fine particulate matter
(PM2.5) and ozone levels on health and have found about 36,000 deaths a year
attributed to these levels [@choma2021, @fann2013]. In addition, PM2.5 has been
linked to various health defects such as respiratory and cardiac symptoms, and
exacerbate many other health conditions [@schraufnagel2019].

Vehicle pollution has been addressed differently across states. California has a
Zero-Emission Vehicles (ZEVs) strategy to increase the access of electric
vehicle chargers along the roadway networks, support local transit transitions
to zero-emission technology, and support the development of zero-emission
freight technology. Delaware established a Strategic Implementation Plan for
Climate Change, Sustainability and Resilience for Transportation, and
Massachusetts has begun a new Low Emission Vehicle Program requiring most new
vehicles to be equipped with advanced emission control systems. Utah has
implemented a Noise Abatement Policy to decrease noise pollution which complies
with federal regulation according to NEPA to be environmentally responsible.

On a national level, however, the Clean Air Act directs the Environmental
Protection Agency to set certain quality standards for pollutants in the air
[@environmentalprotectionagency2023]. States are required to meet these
standards or develop a plan to improve pollution levels. The map in
@fig-nonattainment shows counties in each state that do not meet the standard
for the identified air pollutants. As can be seen, there are several counties in
Utah that do not meet the federal air quality standards for certain
particulates, so there are opportunities for improvement.

#| fig-cap: Nonattainment counties in the United States, identified by how many criteria pollutants are in nonattainment.

```

One problem with fine particulate matter and vehicle pollution is that it has
differential effects related to demographics, with some communities experiencing
more severe health disparities [@chakraborty2022]. In order to more equitably
address some of these pollution problems, the EPA has established a guidance
related to Environmental Justice to "determine any disproportionately high and
adverse human health or environmental effects to low-income, minority, and
tribal populations". This guidance is met through the National Environmental
Policy Act (NEPA), which requires an impact assessment for every federal action
-- including most transportation infrastructure projects -- that could have an
impact on the environment. A report must be submitted describing any potential
environmental or health impacts, or findings of no significant impact. This is
intended to protect communities that could be more adversely affected by new
transportation projects or improvements.

In some ways these national and state measures have helped, and recent evidence
that shows a decrease in air pollution related deaths in the U.S. [@choma2021].
However, more work needs to be done in order to further decrease pollution
related death and disease. This is true for existing facilities that can be
improved to be more equitable and less polluted as well as any new policies or
projects that can be designed to limit or decrease pollution.

### Active Transportation

Active transportation is an intersection of public health and transportation
that includes walking and biking improvements, as well as public transportation.
Both individual activity and public transportation system design are important
when looking at active transportation. When looking at individual activity,
direct correlations have been found between perceptions of well-being and social
contact which comes through walking and biking and in relation to public
transportation infrastructure a positive correlation was found between quality
of life and multimodal trips [@cobbold2022, @gerike2019]. In addition,
correlations have been found between mode choice, the use of public
transportation, and health, showing that the more a car was used for transport,
the higher the BMI (Body Mass Index), supporting the connection between health
and active transport and support- ing the improvement of public transportation
infrastructure to encourage sustainable mobility [@dedele2021, @dons2018].

Active transportation measures and how they impact health can be somewhat
difficult to track, but the best way to do so is by analyzing different data
that has been collected in regards to health and transportation. To analyze the
data on active transportation more completely, the
@usdepartmentoftransportation2022 has partnered with the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) to develop the Transportation and Health Tool. This
tool provides easy access to data of public health indicators and transportation
in each US State and metropolitan area. These data include indicators such as
obesity rates, percent of physical activity in trips taken, and how much federal
funding was used to support active transportation infrastructure.

Using this data from 2017 in each state we created the maps show in
@fig-obeseactivity. @fig-obeseactivity (A) shows the obesity rates by state with
24.2% being the least in Colorado while (B) shows the estimated percent of trips
that include physical activity (walking, bicycling, and walk-access public
transport). As can be seen there does seem to be some pattern, with those states
that have a higher physical activity, also having a lower obesity rate. There
are a few outliers, such as Nevada, with a low obesity rate and a low physical
activity percentage, but overall, there is a correlation coefficient between the
two indicators of 0.64.

#|   - "Physical Activity"
knitr::include_graphics("images/obesityrates.png")
knitr::include_graphics("images/physicalactivityrates.png")
```

Obesity is a problem in the United States, and with these graphs there does seem
to be a correlation between increased active transportation and decreased
obesity. In order to improve public health one goal could be to improve physical
activity in transportation dramatically in states. The highest percentage of
physical activity was in New York with about 20%. In order to improve this
percentage to make 20% be a more normal value rather than the exception it is
important that each state put more of an emphasis on public transportation and
active transportation projects.

### Accessibility to Resources

In addition to helping improve health, public transportation and active
transportation project also improve accessibility to resources. Accessibility to
resources has also been widely studied in the past and will be analyzed more
completely later in this chapter. The main idea of equitable accessibility is to
make sure that each race, economic background, and age has an equal
transportation option or alternative to access different public goods and
resources. Equitable accessibility can have a dramatic impact on public health
and is an important part of transportation policy [@aggarwal2014]. However, the
presence of accessibility to resources in research and application in different
states is somewhat limited.

At a minimum each state must adhere to the federal Americans with Disabilities
Act (ADA) standard when designing roadways or other infrastructure. In addition,
there is the federal complete streets policy that is implemented throughout the
nation. According to @smartgrowthamerica2023, a non-profit organization that
helps foster equitable and sustainable communities, there are 35 state
governments that have adopted complete streets policies, with Utah being one of
those states. Complete Streets requires streets to be planned, designed, and
maintained to enable safe and comfortable access and travel for all users
regardless of age, abilities and mode of transportation.

```{r fig-completestreets}
#| label: fig-completestreets
#| fig-cap: Jurisdictions with complete streets policies in the United States.
#| out-width: "6in"
knitr::include_graphics("images/completestreets.png")
```

This map shown in @fig-completestreets gives a visual representation of which
counties, cities, and towns have adopted a complete streets policy. As can be
seen, even in the states that have adopted a policy, there are still massive
regions that do not have that policy implemented that still need the impact of
equitable accessibility in projects and policy.

## Access to Nutrition

### Access and Equity

Equitable access to community resources has been a topic of research and study,
especially when looking at the impacts on measures of well-being and economic
opportunity. Current social issues, economic opportunity and equity are
significant topics which can help us to ensure that each demographic of the
population can have the same opportunities. Equity as a term is being fair and
impartial, different from equality. Equality is providing the exact same thing
to all people, whereas equity would provide different things to different people
because of their circumstances in order to create a fair system. Lower income
populations frequently sit at a different level of advantage than higher income
populations, including when looking at accessibility [@grengs2015, @hu2015,
@witten2003]. It is important to discover how different transportation policies
can improve accessibility to create better equity. Creating equitable societies
and equitable transportation policies is important in order to remove any
discrimination already present in the transportation network. In this way states
can decrease the disparity that is common when looking at different
neighborhoods and demographics. Perhaps there are low economic neighborhoods
that do not have the same economic opportunity or resource accessibility as
higher income neighborhoods. If we increase the accessibility of low-income
neighborhoods, could that then increase the quality of life and health for those
neighborhoods as well?

In addition to economic opportunity, the connection between well-being and
opportunity is also significant, discovering who has access to which resources
and how that access corresponds to their health [@cass2005, @ermagun2020,
@handy1997, @schwanen2015]. A subjective sense of positive well-being correlates
with increased access to more community resources. This increased access was
specifically connected with variety of resources, not necessarily number of the
same type of resource. This is true for both high and low income populations.
However, high income demographics frequently tend have better access to a
variety of resources because of such variables as available child care, a
transportation source available, or even time available to do things
[@currie2010, @liu2022] . In addition, increased access to resources such as
parks or other greenspace have been found to decrease likelihood of mental
health disorders, as well as improve physical activity [@francis2012,
@madzia2019]. Different age groups each have a different response to access to
greenspace. However, among all age groups there is a positive correlation.In
addition to health impacts, lack of accessibility also affects economic
opportunity when considering access to employment, affordable care, and other
stores and shops [@currie2010, @hu2015].

### Food Deserts and Swamps

While there are many different community resources that can be the center of
study, such as libraries, green space, hospitals, etc., this project will focus
on the resource of grocery stores and discovering any correlation between
accessibility to good nutrition environments such as healthy grocery stores and
the demographic makeup of specific block groups, such as economic bracket and
different ethnic groups. Lack of accessibility to grocery stores can have an
effect on physical health and well-being [@aggarwal2014]. This is related
directly with consumption of healthy foods, as well as indirectly with perceived
sense of well-being.

Much of the current research that has been done has shown a different level of
accessibility for different demographics, such as low income populations. Low
income populations have been shown to frequently have less access to fresh
fruits and vegetables [@algert2006, @losada-rojas2021]. This may not be directly
correlated to the physical distance from a grocery store, but the store that was
chosen for these demographics. In a study analyzing grocery store choice in
Seattle it was found that in some instances, there is a closer store with better
produce, but for some reason it was not chosen and instead a store that was
further away was chosen that did not have the same quantity and variety of fresh
produce. This was found again in a different study, that frequently people will
travel to a store that is not the closest store for different reasons
[@clifton2004, @hillier2011]. This study will help to determine that choice
pattern and identify which variables are important when choosing a store to help
improve accessibility more than simple distance measures.

Areas that do not have any full service grocery stores however are also
important to look at, with those areas being known as food swamps. These food
swamps are an idea that there are locations where there is not healthy food
available, so the only option that is readily accessible for food or meals would
be fast food or convenience stores. There have been studies analyzing the
different food swamp areas and what could be done to improve those areas, such
as adding grocery stores or corner markets [@bao2020]. These food swamps are
areas that discriminate between those without a readily available transit
options and those with easy access to cars, creating a barrier to equity. In
addition, these food swamp areas are especially significant when looking at the
public health impacts of food accessibility and discovering how we can improve
the quality of food available to those in every demographic to create an
equitable solution to health differences.

Past research done clearly shows that location of store, quality of store, and
price of store all have an impact on choice of grocery store and accessibility
to grocery stores. This impacts the quality of life and overall health and
well-being of individuals and shows the importance of discovering which
variables are most significant in grocery store choice in order to improve
accessibility and equity. What much existing research suffers from, however, is
the wide variety of measures of access and the definitions used to describe a
"grocery store." Certainly convenience stores do not typically provide the same
variety and quality of goods, but simply excluding them from analyses ignores
how many people obtain a large share of their daily and weekly nutrition, for
better or worse. A measure that can incorporate multimodal access to stores as
well as qualitatively describe the stores along a continuous array of measures
is desirable.
